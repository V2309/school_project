// Updated example usage of the new class editing functionality

NEW GRADE MANAGEMENT FEATURE:

1. UPDATED User Experience:
   - When user clicks "âž• KhÃ¡c" (Other) button, an input field appears
   - User can enter new grade name directly in the input field
   - When "LÆ°u láº¡i" (Save) button is clicked, the system:
     a) Automatically creates the new grade if it doesn't exist
     b) Updates the class with the new grade
     c) No separate form needed for grade creation

2. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

   GradeSelection Component (Client Component):
   - Handles UI state for showing/hiding input field
   - Manages form data with hidden inputs:
     * gradeId: ID of selected existing grade
     * newGradeLevel: Name of new grade to create
   - Shows visual feedback when "Other" is selected

   Server Action (updateClassWithDetails):
   - Checks if newGradeLevel is provided
   - Creates new grade if it doesn't exist
   - Uses existing grade if it already exists
   - Updates class with the appropriate grade ID

3. WORKFLOW:
   Step 1: User selects "âž• KhÃ¡c" 
   Step 2: Input field appears with green styling
   Step 3: User types new grade name (e.g., "Lá»›p 12A3")
   Step 4: User clicks "ðŸ’¾ LÆ°u láº¡i"
   Step 5: System creates grade + updates class in one action

4. BENEFITS:
   âœ… Streamlined UX - no separate forms
   âœ… Automatic grade creation
   âœ… Prevents duplicate grades
   âœ… Single save action for everything
   âœ… Clear visual feedback

EXAMPLE FORM DATA:
{
  name: "Lá»›p ToÃ¡n 12A3",
  protectionCode: "on",
  gradeId: "", // Empty when creating new
  newGradeLevel: "Lá»›p 12A3", // New grade name
  // ... other fields
}
